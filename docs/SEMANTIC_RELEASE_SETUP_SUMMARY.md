# Semantic Release Setup Summary

This document summarizes the semantic-release setup for the Investment Tracker project.

## What We've Done

1. **Installed Required Packages**
   - `semantic-release` - Core semantic-release package
   - `@semantic-release/github` - GitHub integration
   - `@semantic-release/git` - Git integration for committing changes
   - `@semantic-release/changelog` - Changelog generation
   - `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits` - Conventional commits preset

2. **Created Configuration Files**
   - `.releaserc.json` - Main configuration for semantic-release
   - `.github/workflows/release.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Initial changelog file
   - `scripts/test-release.sh` - Local testing script (not used on Windows)

3. **Updated Existing Files**
   - `package.json` - Added release scripts
   - `README.md` - Added documentation about versioning
   - Enhanced documentation with detailed release process information

4. **Created Documentation**
   - `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Comprehensive release process documentation
   - `docs/CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md` - Conventional commits quick reference

## How It Works

### Automatic Releases
- On every push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions runs semantic-release
- Commits are analyzed using conventional commits format
- Version is automatically bumped based on commit types:
  - `feat` → minor version bump
  - `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, etc. → patch version bump
  - Breaking changes → major version bump
- Release notes are automatically generated
- CHANGELOG.md is updated
- GitHub release is created

### Local Testing
- Run `npm run release:dry` to test the release process without making changes
- This shows what would be released based on current commits

### Configuration Details
- Uses conventional commits preset for commit analysis
- Generates categorized release notes (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)
- Updates package.json version automatically
- Commits CHANGELOG.md updates with a standard message
- Creates GitHub releases with proper tagging

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the conventional commits format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

Examples:
- `feat(ui): add trade deletion functionality`
- `fix(api): resolve portfolio calculation error`
- `docs: update README with deployment instructions`

## Next Steps

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Ensure the repository URL is properly set (will be auto-detected from git origin)
3. Make commits following the conventional commits format
4. Push to main branch to trigger automatic releases

The setup is now complete and ready to use. Releases will be automatically generated based on your commit messages.
