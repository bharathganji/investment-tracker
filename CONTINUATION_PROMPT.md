## Getting Started Instructions

To continue development on this investment tracker application:

1. **Review Current Implementation**
   - Examine the existing codebase structure
   - Understand the data flow and component hierarchy
   - Review the type definitions in `src/types/`

2. **Choose Enhancement Area**
   - Pick from the advanced features listed above
   - Focus on one area at a time for better maintainability

3. **Development Approach**
   - Follow the existing code patterns and conventions
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Leverage shadcn/ui components for consistency
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write unit tests for new functionality
   - Ensure existing tests still pass
   - Test on both mobile and desktop views
   - Verify dark/light theme compatibility

## Key Directories and Files

### Core Logic
- `src/lib/data-store.ts` - Data persistence layer
- `src/lib/calculations.ts` - Financial calculations
- `src/types/` - Type definitions
- `src/server/api/routers/` - API endpoints

### UI Components
- `src/app/_components/` - Reusable components
- `src/app/_components/charts/` - Charting components
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components

### Pages
- `src/app/*/page.tsx` - Individual page components
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with providers

## Success Criteria

The application should maintain:
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Consistent UI/UX across all components
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Type safety throughout the codebase
- Performance optimization for large datasets

Continue building upon this solid foundation to create a world-class investment tracking experience!
