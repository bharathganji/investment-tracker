# UI Enhancement Technical Plan

This document provides a detailed technical plan for the UI enhancements implemented in the investment tracker application.

## 1. Trade Deletion Functionality

### Implementation Details

#### Component: TradeHistoryTable
- Added `deleteTrade` import from `@/lib/data-store`
- Added `Dialog` components from `@/components/ui/dialog`
- Added state variables:
  - `isDeleteDialogOpen` (boolean) - Controls visibility of delete confirmation dialog
  - `tradeToDelete` (Trade | null) - Stores the trade to be deleted
- Added functions:
  - `handleDeleteClick` - Opens the delete confirmation dialog
  - `handleDeleteConfirm` - Deletes the trade and updates the table
  - `handleDeleteCancel` - Closes the delete confirmation dialog
- Added a delete button to each table row
- Added a confirmation dialog component

#### Data Layer: data-store.ts
- The `deleteTrade` function was already implemented and used

#### UI/UX Considerations
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Toast notifications provide feedback on success/failure
- Loading states handle async operations
- Responsive design maintains usability on all devices

## 2. Inline Editing Functionality

### Implementation Details

#### Component: TradeEntryForm
- Added `updateTrade` import from `@/lib/data-store`
- Added `existingTrade` prop to support editing mode
- Modified form initialization to use existing trade data when in edit mode
- Modified `handleSubmit` to use `updateTrade` when editing
- Updated form title and button text based on mode (add/edit)
- Added loading states for submission

#### Component: TradeHistoryTable
- Added `TradeEntryForm` import
- Added state variables:
  - `isEditDialogOpen` (boolean) - Controls visibility of edit dialog
  - `tradeToEdit` (Trade | null) - Stores the trade to be edited
- Added functions:
  - `handleEditClick` - Opens the edit dialog with trade data
  - `handleEditCancel` - Closes the edit dialog
  - `handleEditSuccess` - Closes the edit dialog and refreshes the table
- Added an edit button to each table row
- Added an edit dialog component that uses TradeEntryForm

#### Data Layer: data-store.ts
- The `updateTrade` function was already implemented and used

#### UI/UX Considerations
- Modal dialog provides focused editing experience
- Form validation maintains data integrity
- Toast notifications provide feedback on success/failure
- Loading states handle async operations
- Responsive design maintains usability on all devices

## 3. Comprehensive Analytics

### Implementation Details

#### Library: calculations.ts
- Added `calculateWinLossRatio` function
- Added `calculateAverageWin` function
- Added `calculateAverageLoss` function
- Added `calculateProfitFactor` function
- Added `calculateWinRate` function
- Added `calculateMaxDrawdown` function
- Added `calculateEnhancedPerformanceMetrics` function that combines all metrics

#### Component: AnalyticsPage
- Replaced `calculatePerformanceMetrics` import with `calculateEnhancedPerformanceMetrics`
- Updated metrics state to include new metrics:
  - `winLossRatio`
  - `averageWin`
  - `averageLoss`
  - `profitFactor`
  - `winRate`
  - `maxDrawdown`
- Updated the metrics display section to include cards for new metrics
- Maintained existing styling and color coding for positive/negative values

#### UI/UX Considerations
- Color coding (green for positive, red for negative) maintains consistency
- Grid layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Metric cards provide clear, concise information
- Responsive design maintains usability on all devices

## 4. Portfolio Page Optimization

### Implementation Details

#### Component: PortfolioPage
- Changed grid layout from `xl:grid-cols-2` to `md:grid-cols-2` for earlier breakpoint
- Modified portfolio overview card layout to use grid instead of flex for better responsiveness
- Adjusted text alignment for better mobile display

#### Component: PortfolioTable
- Wrapped table in `overflow-x-auto` div for horizontal scrolling on small screens
- Added `whitespace-nowrap` to table headers and cells to prevent wrapping
- Shortened "Average Cost" header to "Avg Cost" to save space
- Maintained existing styling and color coding

#### Component: EnhancedTable (UI Component)
- Reduced cell padding from `p-4` to `p-2` on mobile
- Added responsive text sizing (`text-sm` on mobile, `text-base` on desktop)
- Reduced header height from `h-12` to `h-10` on mobile
- Added responsive text sizing for headers (`text-xs` on mobile, `text-sm` on desktop)

#### UI/UX Considerations
- Horizontal scrolling prevents layout breaking on small screens
- Whitespace management ensures content readability
- Responsive text sizing improves readability across devices
- Consistent styling maintains visual coherence

## 5. Responsive Design Testing

### Breakpoints to Test

1. **Mobile (up to 768px)**
   - Vertical stacking of elements
   - Touch-friendly button sizes
   - Horizontal scrolling for tables
   - Appropriate font sizes

2. **Tablet (768px to 1024px)**
   - Two-column layouts where appropriate
   - Balanced use of screen real estate
   - Properly sized interactive elements

3. **Desktop (1024px and above)**
   - Full utilization of available space
   - Multi-column layouts
   - Enhanced data visualization
